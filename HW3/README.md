Assignment 1

I set my population mean equal to 100. I created md, a dictionary.
In md I added six new dictionaries, for six distributions. In each subdictionary was a key (sample size), and an entry,
an array of random numbers taken from that distribution.
Then, I took the mean of each array.
For each distribution, I plotted these means, and found that as sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the
population mean.
I also made a histogram of all the means. It is roughly normall distributed around a mean of 100.
