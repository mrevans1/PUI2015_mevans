# PUI2015_mevans

I went to my home directory and edited my bash profile to add the lines "PUI2015="/Users/michaelevans/Documents/School Stuff/Grad/Princip of Urban Info/lab 1/PUI2015"
export PUI2015" and "alias pui2015='cd "/Users/michaelevans/Documents/School Stuff/Grad/Princip of Urban Info/lab 1/PUI2015"'"
